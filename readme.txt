Parses feeds into posts as supplied by affiliate marketing companies


== Description ==



Affiliate Hoover allows the website owner to upload and parse feeds supplied by affiliate marketing companies.

Feed items are turned into posts, with the ability to add categories, tags, specify whether comments and trackbacks are allowed; and to filter items based on individual keywords.

So far it is optimised for Paid on Demand, Trade Doubler and CSV support for Affiliate Window, but you should be able to upload any CSV files from any company.

I aim to add full support for more affiliate marketing companies in the near future.

As this is a new addon I'm keen for bugs and feature requests to be posted.



== Installation ==



1. Install Affiliate Hoover either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server
